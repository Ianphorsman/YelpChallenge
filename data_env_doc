The 'data_env.json' file can be used to set paths to where you've stored
the Yelp json and/or image datasets. You can supply a relative or absolute
path, and the Preprocessor in yelp_preprocessor.py will then know where to
load the data from. If you do not change the paths for your local
environment the Preprocessor will assume you've stored the data in the
YelpChallenge/data folder. Make sure you only supply one of either an
absolute or relative path.
